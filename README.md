# Pizzastycznie  

Web API and frontend written in .NET Core for placing orders in a restaurant.  

# Features  
- Ordering any set of dishes 'n' times  
- Order confirmation email sending to customer  
- Order history  
- User authentication and roles  
- API for administrator panel (Modyfing restaurant's menu, changing orders status, listing pending orders)    

# Possible improvements  
- Frontend doesn't allow all the things that API does
- Frontend is ugly :(  
- Frontend could be a website or mobile app
